Hey!
Here are my Power BI Projects that I've worked on so far ðŸ‘‡

1. Professions Survey - Project 1
   Here I have worked with different professions survey data set and found some interesting facts about how each profession does in different countries, their salaries, and how distance from work has
   played a role in increasing bike sales and more. I loved it.<br/><br/>
   Final dashboard ðŸ‘‡<br/><br/>

2. HR Data - Project 2
   I analyzed HR dataset and came to know some amazing facts on how different genders and age groups are performing, people that needs a promotion and people that are going to be retrenched, also how travel distance
   from work has increased productivity and many more. I quite enjoyed analyzing this data set.<br/><br/>
   Final dashboard ðŸ‘‡<br/><br/>

Hey!
Here are my Power BI Projects that I've worked on so far ðŸ‘‡

1. Professions Survey - Project 1
   Here I have worked with different professions survey data set and found some interesting facts about how each profession does in different countries, their salaries, and how happy they are with work-life
   balance, their favourite programming language, count of survey takers, and more. I loved it.<br/><br/>
   Final dashboard ðŸ‘‡<br/><br/>

3. HR Data - Project 2
   I analyzed HR dataset and came to know some amazing facts on how different genders and age groups are performing, people that needs a promotion and people that are going to be retrenched, also how travel distance
   from work has increased productivity, how many employee live close by, total employees based on job titles and many more. I quite enjoyed analyzing this data set. Surely data does speak.<br/><br/>
   Final dashboard ðŸ‘‡<br/><br/>
